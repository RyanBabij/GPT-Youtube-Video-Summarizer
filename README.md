# AI YouTube Video Summarizer

A Python script that uses yt-dlp, GPT and youtube-comment-downloader to summarize YouTube videos by analyzing their subtitles and comments.

```bash
pip install openai tiktoken yt-dlp youtube-comment-downloader
```

Run the script with:

```bash
python yt-sum.py
```

Youâ€™ll be prompted to paste a YouTube video URL. This way you can easily keep calling it and just paste in the URLs.

- Takes about 30-60 seconds per video, but you can run it in the background easily.
- Obviously it won't work well on videos without much talking.
- The clickbait detector needs improvement.

If you come up with interesting prompts feel free to share them.

If the application tells you something about being a bot, you need to add in your browser cookies to the command array:

```"--cookies-from-browser", "firefox",```
```"--cookies-from-browser", "chrome",```

This project was created using GPT.

## Clickbait detection
This has proven difficult to implement but it's somewhat functional. I have found it best to break the rating system into categories which are currently: None, exaggerated, misinformation, clickbait.

## Issues

* The clickbait detector isn't as good as I would like it to be.
* It's great at extracting lists of things from shorter videos but in very long videos it may have difficulty.
* The followup question feature isn't very helpful atm.

atheism.
2. The conversation explores the idea that morality and purpose cannot be
derived solely from science, suggesting that these concepts are inherently tied
